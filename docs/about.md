**<i class="fa fa-stack-overflow"></i> STACK OVERFLOW**

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1056263/dmytro-danylyk) is my favourite site for self-development. Answers to questions improve both - technical and communication skills at the same time. When I read other excellent answers I gain knowledge and inspiration to reach that level.

**<i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> MY ARTICLES**

When I have free time I write technical articles and documentation. You can found all my articles on my [blog](http://www.juliatorrejon.com) or [dev.to account](https://dev.to/juliatorrejon).
