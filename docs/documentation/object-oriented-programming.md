# Object Oriented Programming

!!! info
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language that is used to solve problems by thinking in terms of real-world objects or data rather than functions and logic.

Additional benefits of OOP include code **reusability**, **scalability** and **efficiency**.

## Principles of OOP

Object-oriented programming is based on the following concepts and fundamentals:

| **Term**      | **Definition**    |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Abstract Class**| Defines the methods and common attributes of a set of classes that are conceptually similar. Abstract classes are never instantiated.     | 
| **Attribute**     | Data associated with an object (also called a data member).                                                                               |  
| **Class**         | Blueprint of an objectâ€”defines the methods and data of an object of its type.                                                             |  
| **Constructor**   | Special method that is invoked when an object is created.                                                                                 | 
| **Encapsulation** | Any kind of hiding. Objects encapsulate their data. Abstract classes encapsulate their derived concrete classes.                          |  
| **Derived Class** | A class that is specialized from a superclass. Contains all of the attributes and methods of the superclass                               |  
| **Destructor**    | Special method that is invoked when an object is deleted.                                                                                 |  
| **Descomposition**| A method of analysis in which a problem is broken into smaller and smaller functions.                                                     | 
| **Inheritance**   | The way that a class is specialized, used to relate derived classes from their abstractions.                                              |  
| **Instance**      | A particular object of a class.                                                                                                           |  
| **Instantiation** | The process of creating an instance of a class.MemberEither data or method of a class.                                                    |  
| **Method**        | Functions that are associated with an object.                                                                                             | 
| **Object**        | An entity with responsibilities. A special, self-contained holder of both data and methods that operate on that data.                     |  
| **Polymorphism**  | The ability of related objects to implement methods that are specialized to their type.                                                   |  
| **Superclasss**   | A class from which other classes are derived. Contains the master definitions of attributes and methods that all derived classes will use |
