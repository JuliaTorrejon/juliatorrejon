# Algorithms

!!! Algorithms
    Algorithm analysis is a way to compare the time and space efficiency of programs with respect to their possible inputs, but irrespective of other context.

## Algorithm Characteristics

**Algorithm Complexity**

- *Space Compexity*: How much memory does it require?
- *Time Complexity*: How much time does it take to complete?

**Inputs and Outputs**

- What does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?

## Common Algorithms

We can investigate some of the more common algorithms that appear in a variety of programming scenarios:

### Search Algorithms

- Find specific data in a structure (for example, a substring within a string)

### Sorting Algorithms

- Take a dataset and apply a sort order to it

### Computation Algorithms

- Given one set of data, calculate another (is a given number prime?)

### Collection Algorithms

- Work with collections of data (count specific items, navigate among data elements, filter out unwanted data, etc)

## Understanding Algorithm Performance

This is an important factor in how you choose a particular algorithm to solve a programming problem as well as understanding how your programme will behave under different circumstances.

- Measure how an algorithm responds to dataset size
- Big O Notation (used to describe algorithm performance)
    - Classifies performance as the input size grows
    - "O" indicates *the order of operation*: time scale to perform an operation (it usually describes the worst case scenario of how long it takes to perform a given operation)
- Many algorithms and data structures have more than one O
    - Data structure can use multiple types of operations such as inserting data, searching for data, deleting data, etc.
